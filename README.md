 ABOUT LGMVIP INTERNSHIP 

LETSGROWMORE is a community of diverse people coming together with similar objectives and ultimate goals. LETS GROW MORE deep downed its roots at the very beginning of this year as a result of an idea that was brought up to be real by the Founder of LETSGROWMORE - AMAN KESARWANI.



Today we are proudly an officially MSME registered startup with more than 100 people working hand in hand with us and breaking our own targets of more than 15 inspirational as well as motivational webinars arranged and many still on the way. 





LETSGROWMORE is all about creating opportunities for leadership development, learning, student engagement, and fostering of shared interests. We develop enriching environments and experiences that promote students' knowledge and wellbeing.



Our goal is to help others to gain personal and professional skills in technical and non-technical areas. The purpose is to provide a structure through which students may exercise their right to freely associate in pursuit of a common purpose or goal.
