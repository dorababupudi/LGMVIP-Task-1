 ABOUT LGMVIP INTERNSHIP 

LETSGROWMORE is a community of diverse people coming together with similar objectives and ultimate goals. LETS GROW MORE deep downed its roots at the very beginning of this year as a result of an idea that was brought up to be real by the Founder of LETSGROWMORE - AMAN KESARWANI.



Today we are proudly an officially MSME registered startup with more than 100 people working hand in hand with us and breaking our own targets of more than 15 inspirational as well as motivational webinars arranged and many still on the way. 





LETSGROWMORE is all about creating opportunities for leadership development, learning, student engagement, and fostering of shared interests. We develop enriching environments and experiences that promote students' knowledge and wellbeing.



Our goal is to help others to gain personal and professional skills in technical and non-technical areas. The purpose is to provide a structure through which students may exercise their right to freely associate in pursuit of a common purpose or goal.

MY Virtual Internship Experience.

Hey my dear github visiters!!
This Blog is about my experience as a DATA SCIENCE Intern in the Virtual Internship Program (VIP) at LetsGrowMore (LGM) Community which is held in July 2023.
Participating in the Let's Grow More Remote Internship has been an enriching experience, despite the physical distance.
During this internship I have completed 4 tasks,those I've posted on LinkedIn profile.
I would like to thank Aman Kesarwani Kesarwani and the team of LetsGrowMore (LGM) Community (LGM) Community for giving me this opportunity to enhance my skills and work on amazing projects.

The overall internship experience was awesome. This helped me to enhance my skill set.
